Computer networks may be one of those subjects that a lot of people "kinda understand".
It was like that for me, at least. With all the things that we are expected to know as software engineers,
it's quite easy to skim through some topics so that we can focus on the subject
that'll help us land that job we're eyeing. Watch that tutorial about a particular stack
or learn the OSI model and the
intricacies of establishing a TCP connection? Most of the time, most of us would go with the first one.

Still, it's a dangerous thing. We usually take for granted the things we use daily and that we don't
fully understand. In some cases, that's completely fine and understandable. I don't need to know how
a train works to use it. So, it's only natural that I "kinda know" how computer networks function, right?

I disagree. Sure, you can and _should_ prioritize the knowledge you think will get you closer to your goals,
but I also think that it's very beneficial to sometimes take a step back and look at the bigger picture, at how
things really work. It'll make you a more well-rounded professional.

In this article, I'm going to take a step back and attempt to condense the essentials about computer
networks, the things I think every modern software engineer should know. I won't explain everything, as
that would require a whole college semester (more, probably), but I will also provide some reference
materials you can check out if you want to learn more.

I personally find this topic very interesting. And besides, even if you don't, it's only about the technologies
that make the Internet (and you reading this article) possible. Can't be that important, right?
