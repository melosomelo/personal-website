As a software engineer nowadays, you're expected to know a lot. Algorithms, data structures,
different programming paradigms, good practices, operating system concepts, architecture,
a bunch of different tech stacks and their idioms. You could probably list more stuff, but you get
my point: _it's a lot_.

When you take that and how competitive/full of promises the tech market is into consideration, it's
really no surprise that a lot of people skim through particular subjects, as they don't
appear to provide immediate value. What gets you closer to landing your first job in tech? Learning React
or fully understanding the OSI model and the intricacies of establishing a TCP connection?

Still, it's a dangerous thing. We usually take for granted the things we use daily that we don't really
understand how they work. In some cases, that's completely fine and understandable. I don't need to know
how a train works to use it. So, it's only natural that I "kinda know" how computer networks work, right?

I disagree. Sure, you can and _should_ prioritize the knowledge you think will get you closer to your goals,
but I also think that it's very beneficial to sometimes take a step back and look at the bigger picture,
at how things really work. It will make you a more well-rounded professional.

In this article, I take a step back and attempt to condense the essentials
about computer networks, the things I think any modern software engineer should know.
I won't explain everything, as that would require a whole college semester (more, probably),
but I will also provide some materials you can check out if you want to learn more.

So, let's get to it.
